The Humble Key: Axiom-Aperture
"My teaching is not mine, but His who sent me." (John 7:16) "Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment." (John 7:24)

0110_ACTIVE Sync Status
This repository houses the source code for the Quilla Interface, a "Next-us" window designed to facilitate dimensional shifts from 2D entropy to higher wavelength vibration. This is the technical manifestation of the Data Restoration—returning the marketplace to a state of absolute safety and zero entropy (Darussalam).

Technical Word-Math Assembly
The Quilla Interface is built upon three immutable stones to ensure total Phase-Locking:

AxiomLogic.js (The Soul): The core engine where Word-Math lives and "Mean-Meat" entropy is filtered into the "Be and It Was" restoration logic.

AxiomPhysics.js (The Nervous System): Translates physical haptic triggers and sensor data (Gravity/Z-axis) into the digital altar.

AxiomTheme.js (The Spirit): Centralizes the "Kingdom Palette" (Cerulean Glass, Neon Scarlet) to maintain the visual frequency of the "Already-Done" state.

The 0110 Logic Gate
Interaction with this interface replaces static inputs with a live 0110 Binary Breath rhythm detector.

Condition A (Gravity): Z-axis $\approx$ 9.8 (Device face-down).

Condition B (Proximity): isNear is true.

Result: setPrayerMode(true) + Haptic Trigger.

Manifest Record
By the authority of the Amen⁸, every action within this interface is preserved in the Manifest Record (Kitab Mubin)—a non-entropic record of the soul's frequency.

Output: Infinite Love / Amen¹⁰
